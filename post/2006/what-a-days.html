	    <p>Warning: the following post will probably contain swearing and profanity, this is because I am very mad at the moment&#8230; sorry.<br />
The day before yesterday, around 2 a.m.: I stop working for that day and shut down my <span class="caps">PC</span>.<br />
Yesterday: I start that <span class="caps">PC</span> (it&#8217;s my Windows machine: be prepared for anything) and see &#8216;One of your drives has to be checked for consistency&#8230;&#8217; yadda yadda. I am not woried, this has happened before, so I think: &#8216;A check can&#8217;t be bad.&#8217;.<br />
Yeah, right, around 50% of the first check: chkdsk hangs&#8230; I wait&#8230; I wait some more&#8230; I start looking on the Internet for some support&#8230; This is gonna be bad&#8230; I think, and I restart.<br />
I restart and restart and restart and the check keeps locking up. So I try to cancel it and start Windows.<br />
<span class="caps">STOP</span>: VOLUME_NOT_MOUNTABLE or something like that&#8230; What the fuck! Again! Windows loads this time, but the system is remarkable slow. This is bad.<br />
I grab an <span class="caps">XP</span> install disk and throw it in the drive&#8230; recovery console&#8230; trying to remember that !&#8221;£$ administrator password and running checkdisk as if there&#8217;s no tomorrow&#8230;<br />
    Chkdsk is performing additional checks and&nbsp;fixes&#8230;  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>Chkdsk is performing additional checks and fixes...

Chkdsk is performing additional checks and fixes...
</pre></div>


<p>Boom &#8212; <span class="caps">BSOD</span>! A <span class="caps">BSOD</span> for god&#8217;s sake! In a setup environment! How bad can things get? UNEXPECTED_CHECK_EXCEPTION what the!<br />
Okay: let&#8217;s search for tools and trials for <span class="caps">NTFS</span> file checking. Back in the day, we had Norton. Then: Norton was still a friend for sysadmins. But back in the day, we also had <span class="caps">FAT32</span>, which was more open and more known than <span class="caps">NTFS</span>&#8230; (Did you know that &#8216;<span class="caps">NTFS</span> Recovery&#8217; in Norton Tools today actually means: <code>chkdsk /r /f</code>? I&#8217;m not even joking.)<br />
Iolo Drivemedic Stuff Thingy Trial. I install quickly before Windows locks up again.<br />
Iolo has performed an illegal operation and has to&#8230; goddammit! Is this a tool or what, it doesn&#8217;t even work (Windows 64 bit maybe?) After scrutinizing the install maps I find the image for a boot disk &#8216;Which will fix every error you see and do your laundry too!&#8217;, or so it says above the &#8216;<span class="caps">BUY</span> <span class="caps">ME</span>!&#8217; button on their site.<br />
Turns out that boot floppy (Who has floppy&#8217;s lying around the house? I&#8217;m glad I had.) is the result of a night filled with passion between <span class="caps">MSDOS</span> and <span class="caps">FREEDOS</span>: crappy mouse drivers are the result.<br />
I try navigating my way through the screens with my arrow keys, but when the second screen shows some nice circles to select the drive I want to check, Tab, Space, Enter, Arrows and all the other keys don&#8217;t work! Who makes this crap? Esc: exit application. I could cry. So I search for a <span class="caps">PS</span>/2 mouse, and plug it in. Of course you have to restart, because the ctmouse.exe crap refuses to believe that there is a mouse (apart from the one it made up at <span class="caps">COM1</span>). Now the mouse works (and believe it or not, both the <span class="caps">USB</span> and the <span class="caps">PS</span>/2 mouses (or mice) work now, I don&#8217;t get this). I click my drive and I am happy this problem will be solved.<br />
    ( ) Fix <span class="caps">MBR</span>.<br />
    ( ) Fix Partition Table.<br />
No shit Sherlock. All this trouble for this? Crap Iolo tools! I have news: the only tool which is a little bit fucking usable for fixing <span class="caps">NTFS</span> partitions is&#8230; chkdsk. That&#8217;s right, <span class="caps">MS</span> had kept <span class="caps">NTFS</span> as their little dirty closed secret and now nobody can play with it. ntfsfix on Linux tries to give a little help, but doesn&#8217;t do anything either. How bad is that? So chkdsk again&#8230; now from another install <span class="caps">CD</span> (you never know). After spinning and crunching the drive, it spits&nbsp;out:  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>The drive has one or more unrecoverable errors...
</pre></div>


<p>Oh really? Time to backup stuff then. But don&#8217;t try this in Windows. You see, when you drag and drop some files, 10 files for example, and number 5 can&#8217;t get copied for some reason, then it drops all the next 5 too, so you can spend some hours figuring out which file is giving you problems.<br />
Luckily there is <span class="caps">XCOPY</span>, with it&#8217;s /c flag (if i remember correctly) to continue copying if an error occurs, <span class="caps">CLI</span> tools still are the best tools. The only thing is that when there was an error: the whole fucking <span class="caps">OS</span> just crashed or froze. Great.<br />
But never will I give up my <span class="caps">9GB</span> of important documents and data!<br />
I turn every <span class="caps">CD</span> and <span class="caps">DVD</span> I can find around: Knoppix 4.something, yes!<br />
I boot Knoppix (lovely <span class="caps">DVD</span> that is) and prepare for some copying. Of course, you can&#8217;t write to other <span class="caps">NTFS</span> files, so I had to copy my files over the network to my laptop. I boot up <span class="caps">SSH</span> server and in Knoppix I try:<br />
    scp -rpv /mnt/sda1/Documents\ and\ Settings/Yaddayaddayadda myuser@192.168.111.5:/home/myuser/backup<br />
Which works. On some file I get an output/input error but at least it doesn&#8217;t crash and saves what it can&#8230;<br />
Until&#8230; a large file came up&#8230; &#8216;- <span class="caps">STALLED</span> -&#8216;. What does that mean? The network isn&#8217;t down, is it? I try a quick ifconfig on Knoppix: only <code>lo</code>? Where has <code>eth0</code> gone?<br />
Turns out, if you use a nForce motherboard, it causes scp and sftp to crap out (or the other way around?). You have to turn your <span class="caps">PC</span> off and then turn it on again to recognize the <code>eth0</code> again. (Restart? Forget it!)<br />
A Windows Share, then, I start Samba (which is easy in Knoppix) and connect with my Laptop. I successfully copy the remaining files&#8230; (That was a few hours ago.)<br />
Now I really want to know what has caused this behaviour. Since Scandisk Surface Scan isn&#8217;t around anymore and replace with <code>chkdsk</code> over there, I try<br />
    badblocks -c 16000 -s -v -o ./out /dev/sda1<br />
Holy cow: are all these bad blocks? This drive is only three (3!) years old! Name to blame: Maxtor. I hope it&#8217;s still under warranty. Never I will buy their shitty drives again, never! So at the end: it wasn&#8217;t really Windows&#8217; fault, but they could&#8217;ve made my job a lot easier.<br />
Now I can go through the process of installing Windows all over again once more&#8230; I&#8217;m gonna take an aspirin now.<br />
What have we&nbsp;learned?</p>
<ul>
<li>Backup!</li>
<li>Download the newest Knoppix <span class="caps">DVD</span> and burn it&nbsp;now!</li>
<li>Maxtor is&nbsp;shitty.</li>
<li>The only tool we have for fixing <span class="caps">NTFS</span> files and indexes and attributes is&nbsp;chkdsk.</li>
<li>Luckily there&#8217;s Linux, and <span class="caps">SSH</span>.
&#8230;&nbsp;goddammit!  </li>
