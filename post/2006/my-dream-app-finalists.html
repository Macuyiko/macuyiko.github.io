	    <p><a href="http://mydreamapp.com/">My Dream App</a> &#8212; &#8220;Idol 2006&#8221; for Mac developers, has begun announcing finalists with &#8212; at this moment &#8212; still 15 people to go.<br />
All the ideas are looking pretty neat at the moment:<br />
<em> Anders - Stick-It: &#8216;A modernized sticky solution that lets people use virtual stickies just as they do in real life.&#8217; Sounds really cool and handy, but I think this app will have a hard time to compete with existing or comparable apps.<br />
</em> Andrew - Desktop Wars: an <span class="caps">RTS</span> game played on your desktop. As a matter of fact, I once tried to make a similar game when I was younger and when I had almost no programming experience. I never completed it. So I&#8217;m pretty exited about this idea.<br />
<em> Bogumil - Herald: a virtual newspaper app, using <span class="caps">RSS</span> and other technologies. Looks promising and it would be a great app if it can introduce the concept of <span class="caps">RSS</span> to more people.<br />
</em> Farzad - Portal: &#8216;File syncing from the future.&#8217; I almost never use file-syncing apps (mostly because most of them are a pain to use). So if this app works out, it will make a lot of people happy!<br />
<em> Joe - Puppet Constructor: Flash for beginners: manipulate and animate &#8216;puppets&#8217; with the ease of a toy. This is great, everyone who starts working with a complex app like Flash, or Photoshop or a 3d animation program wants to imitate &#8216;all that cool stuff&#8217; they saw online or in magazines, only to be dissapointed with the steep learning curve. This app will probably provide hours of fun.<br />
</em> Michael - Chatboard: a virtual whiteboard. Has the potential to turn into a great collaboration tool, but it will again be a challenge to compete with other products in my opinion.<br />
<em> Michael - Cookbook: a lovely idea. Of course there already are cookbook applications, but this one will do online shopping, voiceovers, sharing, and more, the <a href="http://www.happylandfill.com/uiconcepts/images/cookbook_detailed.jpg">concept screenshot</a> looks really neat.<br />
</em> Peter - Bubble Fish: &#8216;Bubble Fish is the friend who knows everything, but without the annoyance factor.&#8217; With the abily to search on Flickr, Google and Wikipedia, this could turn out as a very handy little research tool.<br />
* Windy - iStyleIt: a &#8216;virtual closet for your Mac&#8217;, pick out, arrange and rate clothes and combinations. Sounds like a silly idea? Not really when you think about it. Share combinations with friends and save time in the morning when choosing what to wear. Even me (a guy!) like this idea&#8230; a modern&nbsp;life-app.  </p>
<p>Be sure to check out <a href="http://mydreamapp.com">http://mydreamapp.com</a>, this whole &#8216;contest-concept&#8217; is very entertaining and I will surely keep an eye on further development.<br />
The only downside? Mac only, but it&#8217;s better than Windows-only (now maybe some apps have the chance to get ported to Linux, one can hope).<br />
See you next&nbsp;time! </p>
