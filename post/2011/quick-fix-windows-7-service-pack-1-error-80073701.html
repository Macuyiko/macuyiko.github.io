	    <p>If your Windows 7 service pack upgrade is failing with error code 80073701, you might be able to fix it with the following steps. I&#8217;ve had to search around quite a bit before resolving this error, mainly because I saw the first and second solutions listed below pop up everywhere, but it was the third solution that actually fixed the problem for me in the&nbsp;end.</p>
<h3>Solution 1: reset Windows Update components (you&#8217;ve probably done this&nbsp;already)</h3>
<p>Download the Fix It tool from <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/en-us">this Microsoft <span class="caps">KB</span> article</a> and run it. Afterwards, restart your computer and try installing <span class="caps">SP1</span>&nbsp;again.</p>
<h3>Solution 2: run the System Update Readiness Tool (you&#8217;ve probably done this,&nbsp;too)</h3>
<p>The tool can be downloaded from <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821/en-us">this Microsoft <span class="caps">KB</span> article</a>. Make sure to download the correct version. Note that the updates installed by this tool might take a <em>long</em> time to complete. It will appear as if the installation process is stuck. Don&#8217;t worry, as the progress bar might go from zero to hundred per cent in an instant, just be patient. Afterwards, restart your computer and try installing <span class="caps">SP1</span>&nbsp;again.</p>
<h3>Solution 3: check out the logs and run lpksetup (this might be&nbsp;new)</h3>
<p>Still no dice? Then check the logs at <code>c:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CheckSUR.log</code> and/or <code>c:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CheckSUR.persist.log</code>. These will give you more detailed information about the error. For me, and for <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/249641/error-80073701-when-installing-windows-7-service-pack-1">this user</a> at superuser.com, the culprit was a language&nbsp;pack.</p>
<p>However, contrary to the user mentioned above, I am not using a language other than the default English, and cannot recall ever installing one. I ignored the language pack problem (as re-installing a language pack was not an option for me) until I learned about the Language Pack Setup Tool. Just run <code>lpksetup.exe</code> from your Start Menu. A window will pop up asking you if you want to install or uninstall a language pack. Pick uninstall. Sure enough, a list of languages was presented: English (the in use, default and system language), and some other language (Portuguese or Spanish, I can&#8217;t remember) with a yellow danger sign marking that it was in a broken state. Very strange indeed. After selecting the language for removal and pressing next, the situation was promptly resolved. Deinstalling the language took just a few seconds, probably because no language files were actually present on the&nbsp;disk.</p>
<p>Anyway, after this small operation, installing <span class="caps">SP1</span> went&nbsp;smoothly.</p>
