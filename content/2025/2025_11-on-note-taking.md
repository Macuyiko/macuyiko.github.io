Title: Thoughts on Note Taking

I never realized it, but I’ve spent years trying to organize my thoughts. Since I was 15, there’s only been one truly reliable way: pen and paper. The notebook was always close, and just writing something down was enough.  

There’s something about the tactile feel. Over time, the notebook becomes a running log of thoughts, and every ten or thirty pages, I copy over a to-do list by hand.  

That’s the part that always bothered me: carrying those long-term, global tasks through every page. Even though the pages in between break them down further, you still have to thumb back.  

But the alternatives are sadly worse. E-ink tablets, note-taking apps… I can’t handle systems that need 100 plugins just to feel “personal.” I don’t want to spend hours building knowledge graphs or perfect tagging systems. It always leads to the same place:  

1. You keep it in your head anyway.  
2. You forget to model something and worry about it.  
3. You spend more time maintaining the system than the content.  

You end up optimizing your anxiety. So I tried to find something simpler. My pick was [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/). Open source, Markdown-based, no AI. It works well, until it does't. Because every note-taking tool eventually leads you to the same place: a hierarchy. You organize, categorize, label. Everything in its tree structure, or neatly tagged. Then you start wondering: how do I organize *the tags*? What’s the best “semantic” naming scheme? You think, “It should be year first, then category, then note: `2XXX / CATEGORY / NOTE` — that’ll sort beautifully!”  

But it never does.  

You either end up with:

- **A bush** with too many leaves but no depth, too messy to navigate.  
- **A dead tree** with no leaves at all, just empty branches.  

So here’s what I plan to do:  

1. **Keep a running log.** Use pen and paper. Any tech will sneak structure back in. I recently bought the iA Writer notebook, not because it’s pretty (though it is), or sponsored (it’s not), but because it reminded me of the stack of unwritten notebooks in my drawer. I missed that. Anything goes in this. And it’s always more fun flipping through old notebooks than scrolling through the ghost of some abandoned markdown folder.  

2. **Handle only the main themes elsewhere.** The things that showed up again and again every ten pages in the paper notebook. Just find the patterns that stuck. Don't make the organization to deep, work topic / project - based instead.
