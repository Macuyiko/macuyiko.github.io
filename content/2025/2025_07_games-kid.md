My daughter was born in 2019. By now, she's almost six years old. Whilst fatherhood has not been an easy experience, ever since she was born I have been trying to find ways to connect to her by introducing interests I enjoy -- or at least did when I was young. This includes reading (not a success at first but now getting better), playing with constructive toys (wooden blocks are not her thing but Lego starts to slowly be), and games, which worked from pretty early on. Perhaps a result of giving her way more screen time than is proper for a kid, but kids also explore their own interests. Luckily she has a lot of off-screen activities as well, so by now she identifies solo screen time mainly as a way to wind down and relax and joint screen time as a way to have fun with dad -- me.

I mention "at least did when I was young" because I receive way less pleasure from actual gaming than I used to. I keep up with them and still compulsively buy games, but most of the time I would prefer to just rot in front of YouTube rather than actual playing. The past months, however, I have been surprised by how playing together with my child has sparked my love for games again. Initially somewhat rooted in frustration (this game is boring and why do I have to lose every time?), but now finding shared laughter and enjoyment of gameplay systems that work for both of us and being in awe that she can also recognize what makes for a fun game.

As someone who knows a lot about games, I thought it would be an easy job to find and identify such games -- meaning good to play with a child, but that turned out to be a struggle. So this post is twofold: First as a memory to myself about what I played with my kid and pre-emptively rekindling some memories for a later time, but also to give some guidance for others. Organized by time but my memory is hazy.

**Year 0**

- Forget about it, they cry and poop.
- Don't introduce electronic games into your house. Keep it tactile.

**Year 1**

- I remember coding a fireworks game (no idea why it had to be fireworks, I thought all kids like it), following the great [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/27-fireworks), using [Processing](https://processing.org/) which I already knew well.
- I teach her to click the mouse (which didn't work), so I edit the code so she can just slam the keyboard.
- That was also not her style but after some examples she does like it.
- Mainly likes to sit on my lap and watch the pretty colors. Some of my best memories are here.

**Year 2**

- She is crazy about dinosaurs. I think all kids are, but surprised girls are as well.
- I code a dino game using Godot. You walk around and bump cars in a procedurally generated city and need to bring your large egg home. She laughs her cheeks off and that's all I care for.
- At some point my of the materials got broken and the dino looks all shiny, meaning she now loves the "diamond" look! Girls will be girls.

**Year 3**

- Hard year. Full of trouble and stubborness.
- Dinosaurs are on the way out.
- In a last attempt to try something I try to play relaxing games together with her. [A Short Hike](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1055540/A_Short_Hike/) didn't land but [Lil Gator Game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1586800/Lil_Gator_Game/) does. She likes me doing the animal voices and the story did make me cry.
- I also try installing some old games I know about. We try the RV car racing game "Revolt" but the controls are not easy (though she is intrigued).
