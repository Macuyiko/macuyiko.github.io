At the end of 2023, certain events in my life led to a realization that I was spending way too little time on reading in the years past, even though I have always been an avid reader in my youth and adult life. Facing some "weltschmerz" and not finding enjoyment in series, movies or games that much anymore, I decided to set out to read more in 2024.

Overall, this has been a success. I found that I still enjoy reading, and the initial months of surpassing the brainrot and having to learn to focus again have been generally beneficial. These are the books I've read:

Don't read too much into the rating system, I'm using a generally bad-ok-good-great assignment (inspired by [https://davidmytton.blog/reading/](https://davidmytton.blog/reading/)) but this is based mostly on subjective aspects.

What I find particularly interesting is how the genre and book themes changed throughout the year. I hope to continue this in 2025.
